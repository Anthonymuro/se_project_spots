# Project 3: Spots

## Description

This project is a structured web development project following the BEM methodology. It includes separate directories for blocks, images, pages, and vendor files to maintain a clean and modular codebase. The project is designed to be easily maintainable and extendable.

## Project Structure

The project contains:

- A `blocks` directory with BEM blocks stored in separate CSS files (Flat BEM)
- An `images` directory with all the images
- A `pages` directory with an `index.css` file stored inside it
- A `vendor` directory with `normalize.css`, `fonts.css` files, and a `fonts` directory stored inside it
- The `index.html` file
- A `README.md` file
- A `.prettierignore` file, which tells Prettier to ignore `normalize.css`
- A `.gitignore` file, which tells Git to ignore `.DS_Store`

## Technologies and Techniques Used

- **HTML5** for semantic and structured markup
- **CSS3** with BEM methodology for scalable and maintainable styles
- **Normalize.css** to ensure cross-browser consistency
- **Git** for version control
- **GitHub Pages** for deployment

## Project Features

- Modular and organized directory structure
- Stylesheets are connected in a separate file
- All sections of the design are fully coded
- Code validation using the W3C Markup Validator

### Overview

- Intro
- Figma
- Images

**Intro**

This project is made so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes. We recommend investing more time in completing this project, since it's more difficult than previous ones.

**Figma**

- [Link to the project on Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/BBNm2bC3lj8QQMHlnqRsga/Sprint-3-Project-%E2%80%94-Spots?type=design&node-id=2%3A60&mode=design&t=afgNFybdorZO6cQo-1)

**Images**

The way you'll do this at work is by exporting images directly from Figma â€” we recommend doing that to practice more. Don't forget to optimize them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so your project loads faster.

Good luck and have fun!
